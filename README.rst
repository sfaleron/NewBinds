Copy a dictionary, while retaining only updates.

The intended purpose of this class is to simplify the code creating attribute dictionaries for class construction, but it would work anywhere a lot of function or class definitions (values that arenâ€™t expressions) end up in a dictionary (or other container, via post-processing); for instance, a container to allow parameterized selection among several functions or classes.

See |tests|_ for example usage.
